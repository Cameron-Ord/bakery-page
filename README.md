## Bakery frontend webpage

A frontend website for a bakery, this was originally a project in my college course. I have spent alot of time learning to code/focused on backend, and want to focus on HTML/CSS a bit more so I'm revisiting and re-doing this project

## WEBSITE LINK
https://bakery.cameron-ord.online/


## To Do
Website is mostly finished as it's nothing more than a simple frontend site, just gonna write some more basic JS to make the overall experience better: how images load etc, some animations.
