## Bakery frontend webpage

A frontend website for a bakery, this was originally a project in my college course. I have spent alot of time learning to code/focused on backend, and want to focus on HTML/CSS a bit more so I revisited and re-did this project

## WEBSITE LINK
**https://bakery.cameron-ord.online/**


## To Do
1. Maybe add a 2nd page to view all products.
